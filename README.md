Array v ArrayList warmup

# In the src folder is some code
Review the code provided. Answer the following questions by adding comments to your code! You are free to talk with other students, and seek better understanding to these questions. See below for reminders on types, variables, and input

# Step One
Answer the following questions as comments in your code:
1. Why might you want to use an Array instead of an ArrayList?
2. When might our Array not be useful? – need to fill it with more entries, may have way less entries
3. What might we want to use an ArrayList for that we can’t use an Array for?
4. What is the type in Python that most closely resembles an ArrayList?

# Step Two: Coding: recallName(Student s)
As a teacher with likely over 100 students, it's nearly impossible to remember all of their names. Find the method `recallName(Student s)`. 
Write the code for recallName(Student s) to use a **for-loop** do the following:
```
if the Student's name and ID match the name and ID of one of the students in the remembered Array, return the Student's name.
If it isn't in the array or if you have reached a null entry, return "Er...You"
```
**Don't forget to include an if statement that checks for the null, otherwise your program will crash**

For example, if someone calls
```java

```

# Step Three: Test [()]
How do you test code? You simply add the lines to your java file (in the future, you will have test lines in separate files).

As such, we would recommend adding the following in main().

```java
System.out.println("TESTING: " + [()])
System.out.println("TESTING: " + [()])
```
Also add your own tests!
